This is how to get Student Developer pack with reverse engineering

### How to use:

First go to `education.github.com` and sign in to your GitHub account, or create a new GitHub account and then sign in.

Next, go to Student Developer pack, and click the button `I'm a student`

In the form, click your email address, and below type in the name of the school that is near your location.

Next write a message to the GitHub team, something like:
  
  - I will use Github Student Developer pack to expand and improve my knowledge in the field of Computer Science, and to
    become a valuable member to the open-source community
    
Next, clone this repository ( make sure that you have Python installed on your machine ) and type:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  or  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the program:

`python3 main.py`   or  `python main.py`

and fill in the info.

It will give you fake "school id" that you are going to upload as a proof back on the developer pack page

Click `process information`, allow the site to use your camera to identify you, and wait.


PS: You have to enable site to use your location and camera, but you can bypass the identification by simply typing the nearest school in your area,
and if you really don't want GitHub to know who you are, just move away from your machine when camera turns on.
